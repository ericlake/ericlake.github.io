It's been a looooong time since I have done any blogging at all. I think the last time I really maintained a blog was about 6 years ago. That being said at my new job my manager has asked me a few different times to make blog posts about some of the work that I have done. To that end this blog has been created.

Mostly I will be posting about things like:

* Terraform
* Ansible
* Kubernetes

That being said since this is my personal space I will possibly be posting non-tech related items as well. If any of that interests you then check back in again soon(ish) for my first real post related to terraform and EKS clusters.

Thanks for now.
