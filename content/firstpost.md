This is my inital post to test the integration between pelican and github pages. My intention is to use this for all future blogging assuming that I can get all the pieces to work together smoothly.

Part of making this work will involve getting auto publishing on push to work as well as having a nice theme. Another thing that I want to have working is the automation of the metadata at the top of each of the markdown source files. Having to fill in the following data each time is kind of a pain:

```
Title: This one makes sense to fill in
Date: Just use the current time
Category: General or something
Tags: maybe, it, makes, sense, for, these
Slug: some-slug
Authors: duh it's me
Summary: Some short thing about the post
```
